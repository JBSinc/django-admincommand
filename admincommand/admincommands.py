from admincommand.models import AdminCommand

# Declare here the classes for which you want to have an available command in the Django admin
# NOTE: This all works based on naming conventions. The file with the form must be called
# admincommands and the form class name must be the same as the management command file name
# (with camel case converted to underscore notation)
